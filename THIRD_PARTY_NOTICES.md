## Sounds

None — no third-party audio ships in this app. The earcons are original works,
synthesized from scratch by `scripts/generate-earcons.py` (sine fundamentals plus
soft harmonics; no samples, no recorded material) and covered by this
repository's Apache 2.0 license. See `App/Resources/Sounds/ATTRIBUTION.md`.
